## 🎯 How to Play

- Use hints or the Auto-Solver if needed!
- Reveal all non-mine cells to win — avoid clicking on mines!

## 🤖 Auto-Solver Algorithm
The Auto-Solver uses a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** approach to safely reveal non-mine cells step-by-step with a short delay (200ms) between moves.
